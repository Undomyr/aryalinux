README
======

The scripts that are found in this directory can be used to build your
own 64 bit Linux Desktop by building the source code of the various
components a Linux System comprises of. Source code that would be built
is not included in this directory and that needs to be downloaded
separately. The instructions in these scripts have been gleaned from
the CLFS-3.0.0 book.

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

1) You need to download these scripts into a directory in your root dir
2) In the same directory create a sources directory and copy all source
tarballs into it
3) Change to the scripts directory and execute 1.sh, 2.sh and 3.sh
4) Get back to the root by typing exit twice
5) Execute 4.sh, 5.sh, 6.sh, 7.sh and 8.sh
